## 🧭 **Purpose & Professional Context**

This repository showcases my hands-on work in **LLM evaluation, dataset tooling, prompt orchestration, and small-scale fine-tuning** — the same domains I manage professionally as a **Technical Program Manager specializing in AI Governance & Applied AI Operations**.

While my day-job focuses on *risk management, evaluation pipelines, and GenAI program execution*, this repo captures the **personal R&D work** I do to deepen the engineering/ML side of that discipline.

**In short:**  
> This is where I experiment with the models, metrics, and behaviors that I govern, evaluate, and operationalize in production environments.

## 🧩 **What This Repository Demonstrates**

This repo is intentionally diverse — it contains a portfolio of practical, minimally-packaged scripts that demonstrate:

### 🛠️ Technical Engineering Capabilities
- Python tooling (Pandas, tokenization, JSON parsing, I/O utilities)  
- Prompt orchestration logic  
- Custom evaluation metrics (e.g., early work on iambic pentameter scoring)  
- GPT-2 fine-tuning experiments with partial layer unfreezing  
- Quantization and optimization on limited hardware (16GB VRAM)  
- Dataset formatting utilities (for supervised fine-tuning or RAG prep)

### 🧪 AI Governance & Model Lifecycle Relevance
- Understanding of *why* models behave incoherently  
- Ability to perform controlled prompt-based evaluations  
- Failure-mode analysis (semantic drift, instability, overfitting)  
- Logging patterns that mirror internal evaluation pipelines  
- Experiment reproducibility practices  

### 📈 Program Management & Systems Thinking
- Translating ambiguous goals into measurable experiments  
- Structuring AI workflows with clear inputs/outputs  
- Aligning fine-tuning work with model safety/evaluation concerns

## 🧠 **Why This Repo Exists**

> I created **scritti** to make transparent that — despite building my career as a Technical Program Manager — I am also deeply hands-on with the *engineering and experimental* side of AI.

Where my résumé emphasizes:
- **risk mitigation**  
- **requirements definition**  
- **AI safety operations**  
- **cross-functional program delivery**

…this repo highlights the *technical underpinnings* I continue to develop:
- Model behavior analysis  
- Evaluation design  
- Scripting tooling  
- Experimentation discipline  

Together, they illustrate how I bridge **AI governance ↔ applied engineering**.

## 🔥 **Featured Work: GPT-2 Fine-Tuning (Before vs After)**

Below is a real output comparison between **GPT-2** and my **fine-tuned model** using the same input prompt and generation settings. The fine-tuned model was trained to capture a distinct poetic style, producing surreal and borderline nonsensical imagery rather than conventional narrative, demonstrating the effect of stylistic fine-tuning.

What they didn't know, until her the hospital stopped billing him for $75 a week—two or three quarters of what he paid in back fees—was that she was pushing him toward that home over there where the men let more money run through the plumbing and had greater bandwidth for the conversation, by contrast, if someone had only run an electric line down in time and slid money back into himself through life.

**🎚️ Top-k / Top-p Sampling** <sub>Decoding strategies that control randomness by limiting token selection to the highest-probability candidates.</sub>

**🧱 Unfreezing Layers** <sub>Gradually enabling gradient updates in deeper transformer blocks to increase control without overfitting.</sub>

**🧮 Iambic Pentameter Metric** <sub>A custom evaluator that counts unstressed/stressed syllable alternation — an experiment in stylistic constraint scoring.</sub>
